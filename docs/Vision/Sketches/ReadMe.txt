The development process:
------------------------

Before making any UML diagrams I started by making some drawing. Afterward I added some more sheets or I modified them.

After the paper documentation was almost complete, I wrote the UML diagrams and started coding. I followed more or less the RUP process.

The first build was to check the critical elements. Here it was the Java dependant functions, because I didn't knew well the Java 1.4 API, and also some others things. So I chosed to make human vs human in game scene. No undo, no AI, no game menus... That checked my system of updating scenes, game logic, rendering, sprites, player input and so on.

Then I added all the other elements of the game as planed or almost. The project was meant to be done by two persons, so I planed it for two. Then I asked for somebody to join me. Explaining the project wasn't hard but when I started coding my parter told me he'd prefer making it by it own to understand better. *Warning French Pompous Comment:* I know that I've a better coding level than most of my class mates, even more in the game development, so I understand that someone can have difficulties following me.

You're French!?

Why did you wrote it all in English when you are French, asks the French guy. I oversaw the publishing of my work and I don't like mixing languages (one line french, one line english). Since I cannot write the code in French because it would look ugly, I'm writing all my projects in English. Some times I forget and I start writing in French. :)

About translating it all, just forget it. :p

Why do I show it all:
---------------------

I could have kept all this work for myself and my teachers. What for? Making games is fun and I won't get more money or respect by keeping it. Even if it's not a professional work, and it was never ment to be, it may interrest the amateur.

I only wish you don't just copy/paste all what you need. Try working by your own, it's fun. And don't forget my name in the credits. ;p
